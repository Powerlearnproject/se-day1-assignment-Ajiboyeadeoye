#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering- involves systematically application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain software systems. It encompasses software product design, development, testing and maintainance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three(3) milestones:-
1. Development of programming languages. e.g C programming language
2. Establishment of Software Engineering discipline (1960s).
3. Rise of agile methodologies in 2000s.

   Description
1. Development of programming languages- The development of programming languages is a foundational milestone in software engineering. Early programming was done using machine code or assembly language, which was time-consuming and error-prone. The creation of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, and later C, Java, and Python, revolutionized software development by making it easier to write, read, and maintain code. These languages provided abstraction layers that allowed developers to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with hardware-specific details, leading to more efficient and effective software creation.
2. Establishment of software Engineeering:- he establishment of software engineering as a recognized discipline occurred in the late 1960s. This milestone was marked by the realization that software development required systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approaches, similar to traditional engineering fields. The term "software engineering" was popularized during the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference, where the need for improved software development practices was highlighted. This led to the formalization of methodologies, processes, and standards that aimed to address the "software crisis" of the time, where projects were often delivered late, over budget, and with numerous defects.
3. Rise of agile methodology:-The rise of Agile methodology in the early 2000s marked a significant shift in software engineering practices. Agile emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional, rigid development models like Waterfall. It emphasized flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements more effectively. The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 formalized the principles of Agile, advocating for shorter development cycles, continuous feedback, and the delivery of small, incremental improvements. Agile has since become one of the most widely adopted methodologies in software development, enabling faster, more responsive, and higher-quality software production.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Phases of Software development Life Cycle:-
 1. Requirement
 2. Design
 3. Implementation
 4. Testing
 5. Deployment
 6. Maintenace
    Explanations
1. Requirement:- This is documenting users' needs and system required in software development process.
2. Design:- Involves creating software achitecture and user interface.
3. Implementation:-This involves writing codes and building the software according to specifications.
4. Testing:-Involves conducting various tests to ensure that software meets quality standards and functional requirement.
5. Deployment:-This is releasing software to the users.
6. Maintenance:- Involves providing an ongoing support, updates and enhancements after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall:-
Linear and Sequential: Development follows a strict sequence of phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment).
Fixed Requirements: Requirements are gathered upfront and remain unchanged throughout the project.
Limited Flexibility: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
Documentation-Heavy: Extensive documentation is required at each stage.

Agile:-
Iterative and Incremental: Development is broken into small cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback and adjustments.
Flexible Requirements: Requirements can evolve as the project progresses.
Adaptable to Change: Changes can be incorporated at any stage with minimal disruption.
Collaborative: Emphasizes collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders.

Appropriate Scenarios:
Waterfall:
Best for projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements, like government contracts or construction projects.

Agile:
Ideal for projects with evolving requirements or where rapid delivery is needed, like software startups or web development.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer:
Roles: Writes, tests, and maintains code to build software applications.
Responsibilities: Implementing features, fixing bugs, collaborating with designers and other developers, and ensuring the code meets project requirements.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:
Roles: Ensures the quality and reliability of the software.
Responsibilities: Designing and executing test cases, identifying defects, automating testing processes, and verifying that the software meets quality standards before release.

Project Manager:
Roles: Oversees the software development process and ensures project goals are met.
Responsibilities: Planning and scheduling tasks, managing the project timeline, coordinating team activities, communicating with stakeholders, and ensuring the project stays within scope, time, and budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Importance: IDEs streamline coding by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one platform, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
Examples: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm.

Version Control Systems (VCS):
Importance: VCS allows developers to track and manage changes to code, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions if needed, ensuring code integrity.
Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges:-
- Changing requirement.
- Tight deadliines.
- Technical debt.

  Solution to them:-
  -Effective communication.
  -Agile methodology.
  -Prioritizaton of tasks.
  -Regular reasccessment of project goal and timeline.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing:- This involves testing individual component or module of the software.
2. Integration testing:- This involves testing the software interaction with other system.
3. System testing:-Involves testing the entire system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing:- This is testing the software against user requirement to ensure it meets users' needs.

   Importances:-
   -for code reviews
   -for automated testing.
   -helps to identify and fix defect early in development process.
   -does lead to higher-quality software product.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering:- refers to creating right queries to effectively interact with AI models, ensuring accurate and relevant responses.
Importances:-
1. precision
2. optimization
3. control


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:- give me recipe to make peanut butter.
Improved promt:-give me a step by step recipe to make a peanut butter.

Why improved prompt would be more effective.
-It's more descriptive.
